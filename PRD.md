# Diabetes Workflow Companion – Product Requirements Description

## 1  Purpose  
Deliver a web application that lets a caregiver record meals, blood sugar readings and insulin doses for several patients, then request a model generated insulin recommendation with a single tap. The tool must remove copy–paste friction, feel fast on every device and present data in a clean visual format.

---

## 2  Primary Persona  

| Persona | Goal | Pain points solved |
|---------|------|--------------------|
| **Caregiver** | Track patient data quickly, get safe insulin advice, edit mistakes | Manual logging is slow, prompts are clunky, dose maths is stressful |

---

## 3  Major User Stories  

* **US-01** Caregiver can sign up, log in and switch between patient profiles.  
* **US-02** Caregiver can record blood sugar value with units, date and time.  
* **US-03** Caregiver can record a meal by choosing a favourite, copying yesterday, or entering free text.  
* **US-04** Caregiver can record insulin by selecting one of the patient’s usual medications (Actrapid or Ryzodeg to start) and entering units.  
* **US-05** Caregiver can edit or delete any previous entry.  
* **US-06** Caregiver can press **Recommend Insulin Dose**; the app shows a progress banner:  
  1. Gathering history  
  2. Building prompt  
  3. Waiting for model  
  4. Parsing answer  
* **US-07** Result displays dose, reasoning, a two line legal disclaimer and a warning if the dose differs by more than twenty per cent from the most recent comparable dose.  
* **US-08** Caregiver can view a timeline and a line chart of glucose values with colour bands.

## 4  Functional Requirements  

1. **Authentication**  
   * Email and password, JSON Web Token session.  

2. **Patient Management**  
   * Create, read, update, delete patient profile with:  
     * Full name, birthday, diabetes type.  
     * Typical lifestyle description and usual physical activity.  
     * List of usual medications with standard units; these populate insulin dropdowns.  

3. **Data Capture**  
   * Date-time picker defaults to now.  
   * Validations: glucose 40 to 600 mg/dL, insulin units 0 to 50.  
   * Quick add buttons: yesterday’s breakfast, favourite meal.  

4. **Recommendation Flow**  
   * Past seventy two hour events are fetched from SQLite, ordered, placed into a prompt template.  
   * Call a reasoning model (OpenAI 4o-mini or Anthropic Haiku) through a single wrapper that reads API key and model name from environment.  
   * Response is stored and returned to the front end.  

5. **Safety Layer**  
   * Check percentage change against last dose; if above threshold ask for confirmation.  

6. **History and Visuals**  
   * Scrollable table of recent entries.  
   * Recharts line graph with tooltips that show linked meals and doses.

## 5  Nonfunctional Requirements  

| Area | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Performance | Recommendation round-trip under eight seconds on average mobile data |
| Availability | Ninety nine per cent uptime for single container deployment |
| Security | HTTPS, bcrypt hashed passwords, parameterised SQL |
| Compliance | All data stays inside container volume |
| Accessibility | WCAG AA colour contrast, full keyboard support |
| Internationalisation | Units toggle mg/dL or mmol/L |

---

## 6  Technical Architecture  

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Front end | **Next.js** (pages router), Material UI for components, React Hook Form for inputs, Zustand for state |
| Back end | Next.js API routes, Express style handlers, with SQLite |
| Charts | Recharts |
| Model adapter | Node service with exponential back-off and cost logging |
| Container | Single Dockerfile exposing port 3000, named volume for SQLite |

---

## 7  Data Model (SQLite)  

```text
patients
  id PK
  name
  dob
  diabetes_type
  lifestyle TEXT
  activity_level TEXT
  usual_medications JSON   -- [{brand:"Actrapid",unit:"IU"}]
  created_at

entries
  id PK
  patient_id FK
  entry_type ENUM('glucose','meal','insulin')
  value TEXT
  units TEXT
  medication_brand TEXT NULL
  occurred_at DATETIME
  created_at

recommendations
  id PK
  patient_id FK
  prompt TEXT
  response TEXT
  dose_units INTEGER

```
## 8  API Endpoints  

| Method | Path | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| POST | /api/auth/signup | Create user |
| POST | /api/auth/login | Issue token |
| GET | /api/patients | List patients |
| POST | /api/patients | Add patient |
| POST | /api/entries | Add reading, meal or insulin |
| PUT | /api/entries/:id | Edit entry |
| DELETE | /api/entries/:id | Remove entry |
| POST | /api/recommend | Run recommendation |

---

## 9  UX Notes  

* Home page shows four primary action buttons arranged responsively.  
* A progress banner appears as soon as a recommendation starts and updates through each stage.  
* Charts accept pinch zoom on touch screens and hover tooltips on desktop.  
* Numeric fields call the mobile number pad.  
* Toast messages confirm saves and highlight errors.

---

## 10  Safety and Quality Checklist  

* Unit tests cover outlier logic and prompt builder.  
* Integration tests mock the model call.  
* Environment variables: `MODEL_API_KEY`, `MODEL_NAME`, `JWT_SECRET`.  
* A daily SQLite dump runs inside the container volume.

## 11  Deployment Guide  

1. **Build the image**  
   ```bash
   docker build -t diabetes-companion .
   ```
2. **Run the container**
    ```bash
    docker run -d \
        -p 80:3000 \
        -e MODEL_API_KEY=your_key \
        -e MODEL_NAME=openai-4o-mini \
        -e JWT_SECRET=supersecret \
        -v /opt/diabetes_data:/app/data \
        diabetes-companion
    ```
3. **Add TLS** with Caddy or an Nginx reverse proxy.
